        <h1>How to choose a standing desk?</h1>


        <p>
          The main differences between our standing desk are the features and
          the different lifting mechanisms used to adjust the desk to the desired level.
        </p>

        <h2>Manual Standing Desk</h2>

        <p>
          A manual standing desk is a type of adjustable desk that
          does not use any type of powered mechanism to lift the desk
          surface up and down. Instead, the desk must be manually
          adjusted by the user, typically using a hand crank or
          lever to lift the desk surface to the desired height.
        </p>

        <p>
          A manual desk may require at least 30 seconds of physical
          effort to be adjusted, which can reduce the habit of using
          the adjustment. They are also subject to uneven lifting and
          lowering because the legs may not be calibrated to adjust
          in sync, and they generally offer a limited adjustment range.
          In case the user wants the desk to stay in a fixed position
          affordable alternatives are available.
        </p>

        <h2>Pneumatic Standing Desk</h2>

        <p>
          Pneumatic standing desks use air pressure to raise and lower
          the desk surface. They are typically adjusted by a lever or button
          that controls a pneumatic cylinder, a type of mechanical actuator
          that uses compressed gas to generate motion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pneumatic standing desks offer the quickest height adjustments. Smooth,
          quiet adjustment with a minimum amount of effort.
        </p>

        <h2>Hydraulic Standing Desk Operation</h2>

        <p>
          Hydraulic standing desks use a hydraulic cylinder, a type of mechanical
          actuator that uses the movement of a fluid to generate motion. They are
          generally adjusted by a lever or button that controls the flow of fluid
          to the cylinder.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hydraulic standing desk is recommended for people needing to lift
          heavy loads with relative speed and smooth movement. However, the
          hydraulic pump usually requires either electric power or hand
          cranking, so you have the choice of being dependent on electricity
          or more manual effort for adjustment.
